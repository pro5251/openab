description: Suite of tools for creating elaborate, multi-component claude.ai HTML artifacts using modern frontend web technologies (React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui). Use for complex artifacts requiring state management, routing, or shadcn/ui components - not for simple single-file HTML/JSX artifacts.

# Web Artifacts Builder

To build powerful frontend claude.ai artifacts, follow these steps:
1. Initialize the frontend repo using `scripts/init-artifact.sh`
2. Develop your artifact by editing the generated code
3. Bundle all code into a single HTML file using `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh`
4. Display artifact to user

**Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Parcel (bundling) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Initialize Project

Run the initialization script to create a new React project:
```bash
bash scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

### Step 2: Develop Your Artifact

To build the artifact, edit the generated files.

### Step 3: Bundle to Single HTML File

To bundle the React app into a single HTML artifact:
```bash
bash scripts/bundle-artifact.sh
```

### Step 4: Share Artifact with User

Finally, share the bundled HTML file in conversation with the user so they can view it as an artifact.
